Poetry

A beach ball far from the coast
went seeking for what it loved most.
Catching every stamp
makes it feel like a champ
as it rolls deftly t'ward the goal post

Being constantly on a roll
requires precise control.
It's better instead 
to roll into bed
when the rolling takes out its toll.

Keep rolling your very own way
though sometimes it leads you astray.
Whether perky or sore
instructions: they bore!
Be happy, come what may!
